Samples : mashup samples
===================

Introduction
============

'StoreXML' stores a blob of uniquely-named XML for later retrieval.


Building the Service
====================

1. Use "ant" command in the CARBON_HOME/samples/mashupSamples/ to deploy them.
2. This will copy directories in to the
<CARBON_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/jsservices/admin directory. If you start AppServer, those services will be
available as a mashup services (jsservices).

Running the client
==================

You can try this mashup service with Try-It.
First of all you have to 'store' XML content before doing retrieve and remove operations of a XML content

Operations
- store

The store operation stores an XML element for later retrieval. The XML element can be given a name token (xs:NCName) to aid in retrieval, update, or removal of the element. This operation returns a copy of the XML element stored (when successful) or a element when it fails. If the name already exists, the XML associated with it is replaced by the submitted value.

example request
<body>
   <p:store xmlns:p="http://services.mashup.wso2.org/storexml?xsd">
      <name>wso2</name>
      <value><product>ms</product></value>
   </p:store>
</body>

- retrieve
The retrieve operation fetches an XML element previously stored, using the "name" under which the element was stored. This operation returns a copy of the requested XML element (when successful) or a element when it fails (e.g. no element has been stored with that name).

example request
<body>
   <p:retrieve xmlns:p="http://services.mashup.wso2.org/storexml?xsd">
      <name>wso2</name>
   </p:retrieve>
</body>

- remove
The remove operation deletes an XML element previously stored, using the "name" under which the element was stored. This operation returns a copy of the XML element that has just been deleted (when successful) or a element when it fails.

example request
<body>
   <p:remove xmlns:p="http://services.mashup.wso2.org/storexml?xsd">
      <name>wso2</name>
   </p:remove>
</body>
