Sample: MTOM (Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism)
=========================================================

Introduction:
============

This sample demonstrates the capabilities and power of MTOM. MTOM Web Service accepts a 
fileName and DataHandler. This DataHandler contains the binary content which will eventually save to a 
temporary location to the given fileName. This sample will save files under CARBON_HOME/tmp/mtom/<fileName>.

Prerequisites
=============
Apache Ant 1.6.2 or higher. 

Running the Sample:
===================
1. Use "ant" command in the CARBON_HOME/samples/MTOM/ to build the service.
2. Generated service (MTOMService.aar) gets copied to the $CARBON_HOME/repository/deployment/server/axis2services automatically.
3. Start AppServer server using $CARBON_HOME/bin/wso2server.sh or $CARBON_HOME/bin/wso2server.bat.
4. Use the script run-client.sh or run-client.bat file to invoke the client using arguments 
   -file {file that needs to be sent to the service} -fileName {name of file to be created on server side} ex:
   ./run-client.sh -file /tmp/wwe.jpg -fileName wrestling.jpg


Note
==============
Sometimes, it may be necessary to clean the services repository before you generate the service, deploy it
and run the client. (i.e. delete services created from previous samples.)
